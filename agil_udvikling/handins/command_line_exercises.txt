	- Move Two Folders up / Move one level up
Can technically not be done if there is not enough folders "above" current directory.
Will not give errors when attempted, but nothing happens.

	- Delete last folder/file you created
There's no direct "rm lastfilecreated" kind of command if that's what is meant.
Can obviously always do "rm *name-of-file-created*".

	- Output the content of any file
Can be done on just about any file, however any file that is not stored in raw text (like .txt, .md etc)
will print out something that is basically unreadable.

	- "create two directories hill and hill and move into hill"
Cannot create a directory with name of an already existing one.
Same with creating a file with a name that exists, however nothing happens (no error messages).
